# diabetes-aiml-demo
The purpose of this repository is to create a {thing} that can accurately predict whether an individual will test positive for diabetes. The reason to create this is academic in nature, for me, the author, to get an understanding of systematic processes used to solve problems using machine learning.  The end result will be not only several predictive programs, but also a presentation of comparison of techniques used as well as a refection on what the process has had on me.

## Outcome
To be able to examine the results of different techniques and identify why some techniques were more accurate.

## Tools used
Weka

## Data used
Diabetes data provided by Weka. I do not anticipate heavily processing or transforming the data.

## setup
install Weka
