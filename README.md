# diabetes-aiml-demo
The purpose of this repository is to create a {thing} that can accurately predict whether an individual will test positive for diabetes. The reason to create this is academic in nature, for me, the author, to get an understanding of systematic processes used to solve problems using machine learning.  The end result will be not only several predictive programs, but also a presentation of comparison of techniques used as well as a refection on what the process has had on me.
